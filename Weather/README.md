🌦️ Weather App Development
📖 Project Description

The Weather App Development project is a web-based weather forecast application created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
The application allows users to check current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast for any city or for their current location.

This project demonstrates how real-time data can be fetched from an external API and displayed in a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.

🎯 Objective of the Project

The main objective of this project is to:

Learn how to integrate a weather API into a web application

Fetch and display live weather data

Build a responsive UI using Tailwind CSS

Handle user inputs and errors properly

Implement location-based weather forecasting

Use Git and GitHub for version control with meaningful commits

⚙️ How the Application Works

The user enters a city name in the search box

The application fetches the location coordinates using the Open-Meteo Geocoding API

Weather data is retrieved using the Open-Meteo Forecast API

The app displays:

Current temperature

Weather condition (Clear, Cloudy, Rainy, etc.)

Humidity

Wind speed

“Feels like” temperature

A 5-day forecast is shown in card format

The background changes dynamically based on weather conditions (e.g., rainy theme)

🚀 Features of the Application

Date

Temperature

Humidity

Wind speed

Weather icons

🌡 Temperature Unit Toggle

Users can switch between:
